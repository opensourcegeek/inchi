Note-1. InChI stand-alone executable inchi-1[.exe] does not require dll/so libraries.

Note-2. Example programs which use InChI API library for both Windows (dll) and Linux (so)
are supplied in INCHI-1-API/InChI_API section of this distribution package.
There are examples for C ('inchi_main' application, see projects for MS Visual Studio 2008 'vc9' 
and gcc 'gcc_so_makefile' ) and Python ('python_sample'). Also supplied ther
are InChI API library sorce codes and related MS Visual Studio 2008/gcc projects.

Note-3. To use the shared library, you may wish to create 'libinchi.so.1' 
as a symbolic link to 'libinchi.so.1.04.00'
